And also get the unforgettable story for myself.And last is reading Novel I love reading book that makes me feel included in the story is presented.In my opinion,the nice book are indicating the feeling well of the writer.

                I am the one who has big dream.Always trying to reach big achievement.But my laziness always try to destroy my spirit. One of my weakness is to shy when I want to talk in Front of public. So I decided to show my aspiration through my actions.

                I am an optimist boy.When I was child,my parents always say that I am become a successful person.I am sure that,I am smart,friendl,besides that,I am a creative boy.I always do something that I want and I try to make something different that the other don't mind it yet.I always try to give the best especially for myself and for other people.I hope everything that I want will achieved.

                My father is my inspiration. He always give me some directive to face something and give me spirit to look ahead, and always optimist to try to realize my dreams.He always say that I am the best.The best event in my live is,when I born in this world and be my mother's children.
